# Web-App_Development_Final
I took a class in Spring 2021 called Web Application Development, for which I had a final project. It required me to use a RESTful API, as well as knowledge of Bootstrap, JS, and HTML. The page does have some areas that will not work as expected as I've removed several API keys from the uploaded file.
